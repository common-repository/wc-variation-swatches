== How does Product Variation Swatches for WooCommerce Work? ==
You can get started with Product Variation Swatches for WooCommerce in just a few steps. First of all, go to the "Attributes" section under the WooCommerce "Product" menu. You will find some default attributes that already exist there. Delete the existing attributes from there. Now add new attributes from the "Add new attribute" option. Select the type from the dropdown option and then finally add them. There are three different "types" {Color, Image and Label} that you can choose.

Now you have to configure terms for those attributes. Under the color attribute, you can add different color names and choose a color for them from the color picker. For the images, you have to upload images and give them proper term names. You can also use existing images here. Finally, for the label attribute, choose a name and any number of characters for the swatch terms. You can add or modify the terms at any time you want.

Finally, you have to add them to your variable products. Go to the edit product section of your variable products. Find variations from the product meta box section and delete the existing variations from there. If there are no variations added, then you can skip this step.

Next, you have to add the new variations for your product from the "Attributes" meta box. Click on the attribute name and select values for it.
You can either select all or specific values related to a product.

One last step, go to variations and make all the combinations that you need for your variations. Once you save changes and update your product, the beautiful swatches will appear for it.
